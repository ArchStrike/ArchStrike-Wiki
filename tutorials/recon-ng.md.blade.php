## Obtaining Info About Targets with Recon-NG

This tutorial will go through some ways of obtaining info on a target with Recon-NG tool available in ArchStrike.

First, let's download Recon-NG (obviously you don't need to do this if you have it already installed)

```
# pacman -S recon-ng-git
```

Let's start it up.

```
# recon-ng
```

Now you should see a menu similar to this:

```
[75] Recon modules
[7]  Reporting modules
[2]  Import modules
[2]  Exploitation modules
[2]  Discovery modules

[recon-ng][default] >
```
Now let's get some help.

```
[recon-ng][default] > help

Let's see what modules he have.

```
[recon-ng][default] > show
Shows various framework items

Usage: show [banner|companies|contacts|credentials|dashboard|domains|hosts|keys|leaks|locations|modules|netblocks|options|ports|profiles|pushpins|repositories|schema|vulnerabilities|workspaces]

[recon-ng][default] > show modules

  Discovery
  ---------
  discovery/info_disclosure/cache_snoop
  discovery/info_disclosure/interesting_files


```

There is a lot more but if I were to put it all this would get very long. Instead you can inspect the output on your terminal better.

```
recon/hosts-hosts/ssltools
recon/domains-hosts/hackertarget
```

These modules looks interesting, let's see what they do.

```
[recon-ng][default] > use recon/hosts-hosts/ssltools
[recon-ng][default][ssltools] > show options

  Name      Current Value  Required  Description
  --------  -------------  --------  -----------
  RESTRICT  True           yes       restrict added hosts to current domains
  SOURCE    default        yes       source of input (see 'show info' for details)

```

When you want to learn more about a module, you can use:

```
[recon-ng][default][ssltools] > show info
```

As you see, we need to set our source to our target. I'll use `google.com` in my example.

```
[recon-ng][default][ssltools] > set source google.com
SOURCE => google.com
```

Now I do this to kick off the module:

```
[recon-ng][default][ssltools] > run
```

Pretty easy. Now it will give me output regarding my target. You can try and experiment on your own.

Let's see the other module.

```
[recon-ng][default][ssltools] > back
[recon-ng][default] > use recon/domains-hosts/hackertarget
[recon-ng][default][hackertarget] > show options

  Name    Current Value  Required  Description
  ------  -------------  --------  -----------
  SOURCE  default        yes       source of input (see 'show info' for details)
```

Let's set our source again and run the module.

```
[recon-ng][default][hackertarget] > set source archstrike.org
SOURCE => archstrike.org
[recon-ng][default][hackertarget] > run

--------------
ARCHSTRIKE.ORG
--------------
[*] [host] archstrike.org (45.79.6.151)
[*] [host] mirror.archstrike.org (50.116.42.150)

-------
SUMMARY
-------
[*] 2 total (2 new) hosts found.
