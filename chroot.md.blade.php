# Testing PKGBUILD files

You can contribute to the project by fixing problems in PKGBUILD files which are used to build packages. The best way to build your PKGBUILD's is in a clean chroot environment.

## Building the chroot environment on your Arch Linux install

Please refer to the Arch Wiki which has an amazing [entry](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DeveloperWiki:Building_in_a_Clean_Chroot)

## Configuring pacman and makepkg configs on your new chroot

You will need to edit `makepkg.conf` and `pacman.conf` on your newly-built chroot. You can take the samples on our [github page](https://github.com/ArchStrike/pacman-config/)
