# Guide for getting involved in ArchStrike

ArchStrike is a non-profit organization aiming to create a simple and clean penetration testing distribution for security researchers and enthusiasts. The project is being run by volunteers. We are a small team, so we appreciate any kind of help being contributed. There are many ways you can contribute to ArchStrike. Here are just a few of them.

## Testing packages

Testing updated packages helps catch issues we might have missed. If you find an issue, please notify us via our github [issue tracker](https://github.com/ArchStrike/ArchStrike/issues) or send an email to <a href="mailto:team@archstrike.org">team@archstrike.org</a>.

## Submitting PKGBUILDs

Submitting PKGBUILDs is a good way of helping out. The packages that fail to build can be seen on our [build issues page](https://archstrike.org/builder) and are prioritised for fixing. You can also create new PKGBUILDs for new tools that you want to see added in our repositories. If you are a developer, we are usually more then happy to add in new packages so you can submit them this way.

You can find a more detailed guide about this on our [wiki entry](https://archstrike.org/wiki/contributing/chroot) and also more details on the [contribution details page](https://archstrike.org/wiki/contributing).
