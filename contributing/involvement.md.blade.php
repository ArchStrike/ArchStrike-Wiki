# Guide for getting involved in ArchStrike

ArchStrike is a non-profit organization aiming to create a simple and clean penetration testing distribution for security researchers and enthusiasts. The project is being run by volunteers. We are a small team, so we appreciate any kind of help being contributed. There are many ways you can contribute to ArchStrike. Here are just a few of them.

## Testing packages

ArchStrike consists of two repositories which are `archstrike` and `archstrike-testing`.

You can learn more about the repositories in our [wiki entry](https://archstrike.org/wiki/repositories). You can also study the full list of our [packages](https://archstrike.org/packages).

Testing a package involves installing our `archstrike-testing` repository on your computer. Testing the packages helps us move them into the main repository in which they will be regularly updated and maintained by our team.

After you inform us, we will confirm if the package works or not and it will be moved into the main repository.

You can notify us via our github [issue tracker](https://github.com/ArchStrike/ArchStrike/issues) or any other communication medium you find suitable.

## Submitting PKGBUILDs

Submitting PKGBUILDs is a good way of helping out. The packages that fail to build can be seen on our [build issues page](https://archstrike.org/builder) and are prioritised for fixing. You can also create new PKGBUILDs for new tools that you want to see added in our repositories. If you are a developer, we are usually more then happy to add in new packages so you can submit them this way.

You can find a more detailed guide about this on our [wiki entry](https://archstrike.org/wiki/chroot) and also more details on the [contribution details page](https://archstrike.org/wiki/contributing).
